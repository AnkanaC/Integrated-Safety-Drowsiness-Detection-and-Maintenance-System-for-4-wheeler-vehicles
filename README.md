Drowsiness and Yawn detection using Dlib
Drowsiness Detection System: The drowsiness detection module has been successfully developed. This system uses a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to monitor the driverâ€™s eye movements and facial expressions. The system can detect signs of drowsiness, such as frequent blinking or yawning, and provides real-time alerts to the driver, helping to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
